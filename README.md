# Space-Driver
## Space Driver is a 2D game for Android Smartphones.

### Explore three planets with your driver. Drive, jump, flip, and shoot your way as far as you can possibly go. Be careful though... some aliens are more friendly than others, some drivers are easier to drive than others, and all three planets are completely different!
